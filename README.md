# WCC Frontend Application

This is the FE application (NextJS) for Women Coding Community website.

## How to contribute?

See our [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

## Requirements for running on your machine

- Node (20+)
- [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v9+)

If you don't have node, go to [their downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

If you don't have pnpm you can install it with npm running

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@9
```

Then, install project dependencies

```bash
  pnpm install
```

Next, create an `.env.local` file in your root folder. In this file please paste the following:

```
API_BASE_URL=https://wcc-backend.fly.local/api/cms/v1
API_KEY={your_local_api_key}
```

This will allow your local to connect to the backend, if you don't yet have an API_KEY please send a message via our dedicated Slack channel. This will never be committed to the github repository.

Now you can run the application using

```bash
  pnpm dev
```

You can run also these commands pre-commit for your peace of mind. The application uses husky, which will run these same checks before you can commit.

```bash
  pnpm lint:fix && pnpm format && pnpm type-check
```

For running unit tests, you can use this command:

```bash
  pnpm test
```

Use this one to run playwright (e2e) tests:

```bash
  pnpm test:e2e
```

For running e2e tests in a Docker container (recommended for consistency across environments):

```bash
  pnpm run test:e2e:docker
```

This uses Docker Compose to run Playwright tests in an isolated container.

To update visual regression snapshots (when UI changes are intentional):

```bash
  pnpm run test:e2e:docker:update
```

This updates the reference screenshots used in visual tests.
